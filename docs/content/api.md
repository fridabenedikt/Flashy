# API

Dont worry to much about the `api` folder. Dont know to much about firebase myself.

Anyways, Its where you can check all our defined functions for contacting firebase database.

Currently the code there exists of some configuration and the rest is some clumsy code in order to make it more easy to use the returned values other places in the application.
